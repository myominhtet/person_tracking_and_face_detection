# person_tracking_and_face_detection

Detecting and tracking person using deep_sort with yolov3. Resnet50 is used for feature extraction.
Another feature of my implementation includes face detection with MTCNN

I have no gpu PC.So I implement this in google colab. 

To run project.ipynb, dowload all the folders and upload to your google drive.

In your google colab, folder destination should be like this

<summary>drive</summary>

- [MyDrive](file1.md)
- [deep_sort_pytorch-master]
- [PyTorch-YOLOv3-master]
- [yolov3.weights]
- [feature_extraction.py]
- [project.ipynb]
