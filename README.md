# person_tracking_and_face_detection

Detecting and tracking person using deep_sort with yolov3. Resnet50 is used for feature extraction.
Another feature of my implementation includes face detection with MTCNN

I have no gpu PC.So I implement this in google colab. 

To run project.ipynb, dowload all the folders and upload to your google drive.

In your google colab, folder destination should be like this

<details>
<summary>drive</summary>

- [MyDrive](file1.md)
- [Subfolder 1](subfolder1)
  - [Subfile 1.1](subfolder1/subfile1.1.md)
  - [Subfile 1.2](subfolder1/subfile1.2.md)
- [Subfolder 2](subfolder2)
  - [Subfile 2.1](subfolder2/subfile2.1.md)
  - [Subfile 2.2](subfolder2/subfile2.2.md)

</details>
